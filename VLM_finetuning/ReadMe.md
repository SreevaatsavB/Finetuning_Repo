# Vision Language Model (VLM) Fine-tuning

This directory contains notebooks and resources for fine-tuning Vision Language Models (VLMs) that combine image understanding with text processing capabilities.

## Overview

Vision Language Models (VLMs) are multimodal models that can process both visual and textual information. This directory provides resources for fine-tuning these models on specific tasks.

## Fine-tuning Approaches

The resources in this directory focus on practical approaches to VLM fine-tuning including:

- Adapting pre-trained VLMs to specific domains
- Fine-tuning techniques for multimodal tasks
- Evaluation methods for fine-tuned VLMs

## Use Cases

VLM fine-tuning can be applied to various use cases such as:

- Image-text understanding for specific domains
- Visual content analysis
- Multimodal search and retrieval
- Domain-specific visual reasoning

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Relevant image processing libraries

Note: This is a developing area with new notebooks and resources to be added as they become available.
