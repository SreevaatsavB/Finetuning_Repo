# LLM Fine-tuning

This directory contains notebooks and resources for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation and understanding tasks.

## Overview

Large Language Models can be fine-tuned to improve performance on specific tasks or domains. This directory provides resources for effective LLM fine-tuning approaches.

## Fine-tuning Approaches

Common fine-tuning approaches for LLMs include:

- Full parameter fine-tuning for smaller models
- Parameter-efficient techniques for larger models
- Instruction tuning for better task performance
- Domain adaptation for specific use cases

## Use Cases

LLM fine-tuning can be applied to various scenarios such as:

- Specialized text generation
- Domain-specific question answering
- Content summarization
- Custom assistants with specific knowledge

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Additional libraries as needed for specific techniques

Note: This directory will be expanded with additional notebooks and resources as they are developed.
